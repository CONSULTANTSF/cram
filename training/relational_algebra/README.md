## 1. Introduction

Relational algebra is a formal system of mathematics for reasoning about operations on a common data structure, tuplesets, which can informally be thought of as tables. Virtually all operations on data in contemporary analytics and data science are based on relational algebra.

We will learn, informally, how to think in terms of relational algebra. Don't worry, no theoretical math will be involved!

## 2. Objectives

1. Learn what the primitive relational operators are and how to compose them.
2. Begin to understand how these operators may be implemented on concrete data types.
3. Start to develop a feel for the resource utilization of given relational operation execution trees.

#### 4.1.1. Map

##### 4.1.1.1. Prerequisites

Definition of table...

##### 4.1.1.2. Statement

Given a table of transactions, which you can see by running:

```
?
```

Please return a table that looks like this, which you can see by running:

```
?
```

##### 4.1.1.3. Notes

###### 4.1.1.3.1. Python (Imperative)

This `python_imperative` function takes a `sequence` argument, which has a list of dicts, which you can see by running:

```
?
```

Please return another list of dicts, which you can see by running:

```
?
```

Be careful about potential loss of precision due to rounding. Note that the expected output is rounded to the 4th decimal place. See the `decimal` Python module for more details.
